# odin-recipes
This project is me getting my foot into programming. I am currently learning HTML and CSS and will further expand with flexbox at a later date. Starting off, it is just a barebones website with html  and 3 recipes with a brief description based off of the websites i used to find these recipes. None of the reipes are my own and none of the descriptions are my own.

I am now adding css to all of my pages
