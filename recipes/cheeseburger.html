    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This cheeseburger is a relatively simple one that allows freedom of expression.</p>
        <p>You can fill it with different salad options or different sauces that cater to your needs.</p>
        <p>For this recipe, however, it will be barebones just so you have the right foundations</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>600g Beef Mince</li>
            <li>1 pinch of salt and pepper per burger</li>
            <li>2 tbsp canola oil</li>
            <li>4 burger buns</li>
            <li>4 slices of what ever cheese you like</li>
            <li>8 lettuce leaves (Shredded)</li>
            <li>2 large tomatos</li>
            <li>1 red onion</li>
            <li>2 large gherkins</li>
            <li>Tomato Chutney, or any other burger sauce you like </li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <li>Separate the beef into 4 equal portions. Gently roll each portion into balls then press down into round patties that are slightly larger than your bun to allow for shrinkage.</li>
        <li>Get all your burger bits and pieces out and ready to use. Don't salt your beef until just before cooking (it toughens the meat).</li>
        <li>Preheat the grill to high. Place the bread cut face up on a tray and toast for 3 to 5 minutes until light golden. (If using BBQ, place cut face down on the grill). Set aside.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle one side of patties with half the salt and pepper. Flip, then press a dent into the middle of each patty. (Prevents patties doming when cooking and reduces shrinkage!). Sprinkle this dented side with the remaining salt and pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon oil in a large cast iron skillet over high heat until very hot â€“ smoking hot!</li>
        <li>Cook 2 to 4 patties (whatever fits in the pan) for 1 1/2 minutes. Press down lightly with a spatula (not too hard else the meat juices squeeze out!). Flip, then immediately top with a slice of cheese. Cook for another 1 1/2 minutes (cheese will melt by itself!) then transfer burgers to a tray to rest for 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Slather the base of the bun with your sauce of choice. My order of assembly: lettuce, tomato, burger (x 2 for double!), gherkins, onion, sauce on bun lid, jam it on top of the stack.</li>
